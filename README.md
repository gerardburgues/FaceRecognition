To use this code you will need images. These images are not available. The program does not work 100%.(University Related)


Face recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from an input image against a database of multiple faces from multiple peo- ple. It is usually used for ID verification. In this project will be used for sorting. There are many places we can see the usage of face recognition, for exam- ple, mobiles, laptops, security cameras, etc. In this project, we will go a bit away from security. Iâ€™ll use face recognition to perform the backend of a sim- ple application for sorting images.
  The goal of this project would be:
    1. With a given input image perform face recognition against the
    database.
    2. When a face is detected and recognised we will create a folder for
    that specific person. If the folder already exists the image will be
    saved in that same folder.
    3. Experiment with the results and analyse in what cases there is bet-
    ter performance of the algorithm.
